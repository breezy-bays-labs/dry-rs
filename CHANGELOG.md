# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The
format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

dry-rs follows a deliberate **no-public-release** policy through v0.x —
mokumo is the sole consumer; tags exist for git pinning only. The
release gate is **decoupled per-crate**:

- `dry4rs` v1.0 ships when its CLI/JSON contract stabilizes (depends
  on `dry-core` v0.x).
- `dry-core` graduates to v1.0 only when both `dry4rs` AND `dry4ts`
  consume it (cross-language abstraction validated).
- `dry4ts` v1.0 ships with TS CLI + JSON parity with dry4rs.

See `ops/workspace/dry-rs/20260508-dry-rs-roadmap/roadmap.md` for the
full release roadmap.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial workspace bootstrap: `crates/dry-core` skeleton (lib only,
  AST-library-pure) with hexagonal module layout (`domain/`, `ports/`,
  `comparison/`, `adapters/`, `cli/`); `crates/dry4rs` skeleton (lib +
  bin) with re-export pattern from `dry-core` and 5-line `main()` entry.
- CI workflow with format / clippy / test matrix (Linux + macOS arm64 +
  macOS x86_64) / coverage / MSRV / cargo-deny / ast-purity / docs jobs.
- Repo chrome: README, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, dual
  MIT/Apache-2.0 license, lefthook git hooks, deny.toml supply-chain
  policy.
