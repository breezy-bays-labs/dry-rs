//! `NormalizerPort` — language-specific source-to-`NormalizedForm`.
//!
//! Implemented per source language:
//!   - `dry4rs::parser::SynNormalizer` — Rust adapter via `syn` (lands
//!     with PR 5).
//!   - `dry4ts::parser::*` — TypeScript adapter joining at v0.6+
//!     (parser-library choice between `swc_ecma_parser` and
//!     `oxc_parser` is open as of 2026-05).
//!
//! **IO boundary**: core opens the file; the adapter parses bytes
//! (`&str`). Cleaner test ergonomics (no disk fixtures) and rayon-ready
//! parallelism control from the comparison-engine call site. The
//! wrapper that reads the file owns its own error type (lands with the
//! comparison engine and file walker in later PRs); [`NormalizeError`]
//! here is adapter-only.
//!
//! **Single port, not three**: per [`super`] module docs, file
//! enumeration and reporter dispatch are idiomatic Rust free functions.
//! `NormalizerPort` is the *only* port trait because parser adapters
//! are the *only* polymorphism axis in the architecture — one trait
//! per language source.
//!
//! **Object-safe** (`&self`); usable as `Box<dyn NormalizerPort>`. No
//! `Send + Sync` bound on the trait itself — those add at the
//! comparison-engine call site if/when rayon parallelism arrives. The
//! v0.5 size-bucketed parallel comparison-engine path is the
//! anticipated bound site (see roadmap §"Performance at scale").
//!
//! **Cross-language schema** — [`NormalizedForm`] (with `kind`,
//! `fingerprint_set`, `identifier_set`, `qualified_name`, `span`,
//! `node_count`, `line_count`) is the shared IR every adapter
//! produces. The O8 ADR (`adr-normalized-form-schema.md`) pins the
//! field semantics; every adapter honors the same `node_count`
//! heuristic so threshold semantics stay unified across languages.
